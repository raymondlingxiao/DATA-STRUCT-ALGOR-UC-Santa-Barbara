# DATA-STRUCT-ALGOR-UC-Santa-Barbara
Hi! Here is the project which I implemented with C++, when I was in UC Santa Barbara. 

This project intends to imitate virus attacking the computers in the network and the system defending the attacks.

Measurements invovled:
1. Implemented the Graph structure and used nodes to represent computers.

2. Implemented Union-Find Set to realize Kruskal Algorithm, to mimic virus spreading.

3. Event-driven method to schedule tasks to fix or attack computers in the whole process.
