# DATA-STRUCT-ALGOR-UC-Santa-Barbara
Hi! Here is the project which I implemented with C++, when I was in UC Santa Barbara, taking the course Data Structure Algorithm.

This project intends to simulate virus attacking the computers in the network and the system defending the attacks.(Discrete Event Simulation)

Total Lines > 700

Measurements invovled:
1. Implemented the Graph structure and used nodes to represent computers.

2. Implemented Union-Find Set to realize Kruskal Algorithm, to mimic virus spreading.

3. Event-driven method to schedule tasks to fix or attack computers in the whole process.
